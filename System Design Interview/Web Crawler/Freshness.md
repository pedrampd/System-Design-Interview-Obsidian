Web pages are constantly being added, deleted, and edited. A web crawler must periodically recrawl downloaded pages to keep our data set fresh. Recrawl all the URLs is time-consuming and resource intensive. Few strategies to optimize freshness are listed as follows: 
- Recrawl based on web pagesâ€™ update history.
- Prioritize URLs and recrawl important pages first and more frequently.
